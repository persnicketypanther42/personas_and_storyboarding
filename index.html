          <h5 class="card-title">Motivation</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Entering the world of a user is a pivotal task in UI/UX and product research. So, for the purpose of
            gaining experience in this area, I conducted a mock user study on the self-checkout kiosk of my university's local
            CVS pharmacy. The goal of this mock study was to better understand the user experience at the self-checkout kiosk,
            and to identify any potential points of common frustration. Using a combination of observation and interview
            techniques, I was able to identify several areas of improvement for the kiosk's design. </p>

          <p class="card-text">Before conducting the study, I created a list of questions to ask the participants and
            studied the kiosk's design, noting important components and their functions.</p>

          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Description of Interface</h6>
          <p class="card-text">The CVS Pharmacy self-checkout kiosk provides an alternative to cashier checkout. In particular, 
            it serves to increase the rate of customer turnover at any given moment by providing customers with another 
            efficient option to make their purchases. The main components of the kiosk include a prompt screen where users 
            enter information and receive instructions, a barcode scanner, a card reader with a separate display for 
            information specific to payment, and a bagging area where users place scanned items.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Description of Observation and Interview Process</h6>
          <p class="card-text">Over the course of one hour, ten users were observed utilizing the public-facing interface.
            Three of these users were noted to struggle in particular; these users became the focus of the study and were
            approached for interview after their checkout experience. It is these three whose experiences are described below.
            The interview questions were designed to elicit information about the user's experience at the kiosk, and to
            identify points of the experience that provided difficulty, confusion, and/or frustration.

            <li>Would you say you agree with, somewhat agree with, are neutral toward, somewhat disagree with, or disagree with
                the following statement? “It is easy to use the self-checkout kiosk.”</li>
            <li>When using self-checkout, do you prefer any particular payment method? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Do you have any issues with self-checkout related to the kiosk and its interface? What do you think could be done to fix those problems?</li>

          <h5 class="card-title">Personas</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Based on my findings from field research, I developed two archetypal personas for kiosk. These personas, Andrew and Janelle, are described below with empathy maps.</p>
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Persona #1: Andrew</h6>
          <p class="card-text">
          Andrew is a 21-year-old junior at Brown University who is taking a much needed study break to get a snack, as he has an exam tomorrow and doesn’t have time to cook a meal. Unfortunately, the barcode for his personal ice cream is on a rounded edge, and the barcode scanner is not picking it up, causing him to gives up and leave. Andrew represents the users because he is of college age, purchasing similar items, and faces a common problem among the users I observed: barcode scanner difficulties.
            <img class="card-img-top mb-2" src="images\andrew empathy.png" alt="Empathy map for Andrew">
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Persona #2: Janelle</h6>
          <p class="card-text">Janelle is a 40-year-old mother whose daughter is sick, so she rushed out to purchase fever medicine at CVS. In her rush out the door, she forgot to take her wallet, and she did not read the signs saying she could not make cash purchases at the self-checkout kiosk, leading to errors with the kiosk. Janelle is representative of the users I observed, as she helps round out the age demographics, faces the common issue of difficulties due to attempted use of cash at the kiosk, and buys products I observed being bought (and which are commonly bought at drug stores in general).

          <h5 class="card-title">Conclusions</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Based on my findings, I have identified the following as key components for improvement at the CVS self-checkout kiosk: barcode
            scanner difficulties, cash payment difficulties, and unresponsive screen. The user personas I developed can be used to guide
            future design decisions, and the storyboard I created can be used to guide future testing. Considering that the CVS self-checkout
            kiosk is meant to be a quick and easy alternative to cashier checkout, it is important to address these issues in order to
            improve the user experience.
